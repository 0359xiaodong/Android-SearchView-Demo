Android SearchView Demo
======================
This is a small demonstration of how I managed to get the Android [SearchView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/SearchView.html) widget working nice.

You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/danbrough/Android-SearchView-Demo)

This is a standalone app supporting android versions 8 -> 21 featuring:

 - Proper material theme styling of the search view
 - How to wire up the search view to a ContentProvider
 - How to use the [SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider.html)
 -
